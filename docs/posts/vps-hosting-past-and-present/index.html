I was using ASP.net based blogging software called <a href=http://www.dotnetblogengine.net/>BlogEngine</a>. over and all I will describe my experience as pleasant. Arvixe is a great Hosting Provider, has good up time and has plans which are easy on the pocket, and does almost all the common stuff like emails and cpanel ,blah blah that other hosting provider do, but kinda does it on a low price. I was a happy blogger for an year although I could only manage close to 8 post and and few <a href=http://varunpant.com/lab>demos</a> in that time.</p><blockquote><p>Enter <a href=http://www.linode.com/>Linode</a>.</p><p>Linode is a different beast than Arvixe, this baby gives you way more control than any conventional hosting provider(shared) or a VPS provider generally gives you , and this is done by a custom made dash board panel which has a plethora of features, now Arvixe also has other plans which will end up giving you a dedicated hosting (VPS) and I bet they would be better than most others in the similar category, but Linode (a different league) is like Amazon Elastic,but only for Linux operating system like Ubuntu (debian), Fedora(centos) etc or rather dedicated for them, Linode means Linux Node anyways ;)</p></blockquote><p>If I quote them verbatim:</p><blockquote><p>We&rsquo;re a VPS hosting company built upon one simple premise: provide the best possible tools and services to those that know what they need — better hosting.</p><p>and this is pretty true , they have many features which can be found <a href=http://www.linode.com/features.cfm>here</a>. They also do a Getting Started video <a href=http://www.linode.com/features.cfm>here</a>, if you still have questions look <a href=http://www.linode.com/why.cfm>here</a> and <a href=http://www.linode.com/faq.cfm>here</a>, they also have an Irc channel and other discussions and bulletin boards which can be reached through <a href=http://www.linode.com/community/>this</a> page.</p></blockquote><p>Linode has six data <a href=http://www.linode.com/avail/>centers</a> around the world , so one can switch between them either while setting up an account or even migrate like a hot swap later on, depending on what <a href=http://www.linode.com/speedtest/>speed</a> they would like to get for dedicated regional customers, they do a <a href=http://blog.linode.com/>blog</a> as well.</p><p>Linode does a lotta stuff and does is good, but the bang on the buck is that they have a kinda “<a href=http://library.linode.com/>do it yourself library</a>”, which is pretty vast, quality and covers every thing you need to know, or at least the important bits. I have lately spend hours just browsing through it, this library will have “getting started” information and stuff which you need to do to get cracking!!.</p><p>By the way did I mention that since I had purchased a good(slightly expensive than earlier )<a href=https://manager.linode.com/signup/#plans>plan</a> from them I also decided to write my own blog,I have used python and SQLite so that it stays light weight and have used WSGI . I will soon be open sourcing it at <a href=https://github.com/varunpant/Message>git hub</a>. I used <a href=http://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/>Bottle.py</a>, micro web-framework to build it so I will be calling the software Message, “Message in the bottle…..”, rings any silly bell anywhere ??</p><p>I wish my very best to Linode team and hope some of you linux ninjas would like to give it a try someday.</p></div><div class=pagination><div class=pagination__title><span class=pagination__title-h>Read other posts</span><hr></div><div class=pagination__buttons><span class="button previous"><a href=https://varunpant.com/posts/limbo-game-review/><span class=button__icon>←</span>
