Anyways, I was poking around web to come up with interesting water simulation techniques, as you could see in many games these days, so I did find a reference to an old C-based technique, after little refinement, what I have is a water simulation which uses a very old algorithm based on two heightmaps.
As always it’s a grid based animation which divides the screen into a mesh(more slices better this simulation looks), I use a jagged array in c# to do this (load it with a texture of 640 X 480 dimension ), to animate I use another array of same dimensions, now to make every thing move I kinda do something like this"><meta name=keywords content="Cloud,maps,GIS,Google Cloud,Google Maps,Openlayer,Javascript,go,Hadoop,BigData,Spark"><meta name=robots content="noodp"><link rel=canonical href=https://varunpant.com/posts/water-simulation/><link rel=stylesheet href=https://varunpant.com/assets/style.css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://varunpant.com/style.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon-precomposed sizes=144x144 href=https://varunpant.com/img/apple-touch-icon-144-precomposed.png><link rel="shortcut icon" href=https://varunpant.com/img/favicon.png><meta name=twitter:card content="summary"><meta name=twitter:title content="Water Simulation"><meta name=twitter:description content="Its been a while since my last post, had been busy with office work…sigh!!!
