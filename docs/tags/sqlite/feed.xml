Few days ago I wanted to import a chunk of CSV data, which was 4 GB in size into a table in SQLite.
I generally use Firefox &amp;rsquo;s sqlite-manager plug-in for usual tasks with SQLite database ,hence decided to use the import interface .
I have had a very good experience with this GUI tool and it has rarely failed me, but this time I was disappointed.</description></item></channel></rss>
