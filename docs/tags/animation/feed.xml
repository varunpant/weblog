&lt;p&gt;LIMBO is a horrifically beautiful, monochrome or rather a gray-scale purgatory painted perhaps while watching Tim burton movie on the side. It was published initially in Jul 2010 by &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Game_Studios"&gt;Microsoft Game Studios&lt;/a&gt;(XBLA) and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playdead"&gt;Playdead&lt;/a&gt;(PSN, Windows), and then later released for Windows platform by &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_%28software%29"&gt;Steam&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The primary character of the game is a boy, who wakes up right at the beginning of the game i.e while you are trying to figure out WTF is happening or wonder if you graphics driver (windows platform) screwed up or something, but there as you are fiddling with the movement buttons in keyboard you will see pair of bright white eyes flickering, and that’s when you start falling in love with the game and the care of detail added in a game which is totally unlike other in its league.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Water Simulation</title><link>https://varunpant.com/posts/water-simulation/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Sep 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://varunpant.com/posts/water-simulation/</guid><description>
&lt;p&gt;Its been a while since my last post, had been busy with office work…sigh!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, I was poking around web to come up with interesting water simulation techniques, as you could see in many games these days, so I did find a reference to an old C-based technique, after little refinement, what I have is a water simulation which uses a very old algorithm based on two &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heightmap"&gt;heightmaps&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always it’s a grid based animation which divides the screen into a mesh(more slices better this simulation looks), I use a jagged array in c# to do this (load it with a texture of 640 X 480 dimension ), to animate I use another array of same dimensions, now to make every thing move I kinda do something like this&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>I-Phone Scroll</title><link>https://varunpant.com/posts/i-phone-scroll/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Jun 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://varunpant.com/posts/i-phone-scroll/</guid><description>
&lt;p&gt;One of the amazing features of i-phone user interface is smooth panning/scrolling animation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I-phone “List Scrolling” perhaps gives a very funky and usable List –View to its users and allows them to scroll up and down the interface without any need of a scroll bar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This interface is sensitive to the push speed and also shows traces of resilience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been experimenting with various techniques to bring out similar effect using JavaScript and HTML, I am not quite sure if this would be useful in its present form but with some modifications may be this sample could prove its worthiness somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
