Google has an excellent elevation API however free usage comes with a limit.
While searching, I came across a dataset in geotiff format for landcover as well as a processed version of world elevation. Elevation data comes in various resolution (250m,500m,1km), landcover is 500m .
So how do we read it ?</description></item><item><title>How to create fishnets or geospatial grids</title><link>https://varunpant.com/posts/how-to-create-fishnets-or-geospatial-grids/</link><pubDate>Sun, 11 Dec 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://varunpant.com/posts/how-to-create-fishnets-or-geospatial-grids/</guid><description>There are many use cases in GIS world, where the information has to be aggregated, an easy way to achieve this is via gridding or binning, where the area of interest is divided into small sections called grids or bins.
These sections are mostly of rectangular form (which can be easily converted into geotiffs), but in some cases even circles or hexagons are also used.
You can read a good tutorial from mapbox using Qgis with a mmqgis plugin here.</description></item><item><title>How to transform projections between Spherical Mercator and EPSG 4326</title><link>https://varunpant.com/posts/how-to-transform-projections-between-spherical-mercator-and-epsg-4326/</link><pubDate>Sat, 10 Dec 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://varunpant.com/posts/how-to-transform-projections-between-spherical-mercator-and-epsg-4326/</guid><description>Projections in GIS are commonly referred to by their “EPSG” codes, these are identifiers managed by the European Petroleum Survey Group.
One common identifier is “EPSG:4326”, which describes maps where latitude and longitude are treated as X/Y values.
Spherical Mercator has an official designation of EPSG:3857. However, before this was established, a large amount of software used the identifier EPSG:900913. This is an unofficial code, but is still the commonly usedin many GIS systems.</description></item></channel></rss>
