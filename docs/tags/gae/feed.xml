&lt;p&gt;Google datastore is pretty awesome when one needs a quick no-sql data storage. However recently I have experienced a problem in exporting my GAE Datastore as csv and in certain cases as a line delimited Json file. Its not very hard to do so and perhaps the easiest way to handle such thing is to write an export handler in you web app, however, there are alternative ways which I have highlighted below.
2. One of the easiest alternative is by using &lt;a href="https://console.cloud.google.com/project/_/datastore/settings?_ga=1.52544424.12031260.1450181862"&gt; Datastore Admin .&lt;/a&gt; This tool will easily let you backup you GAE DataStore Entities to google cloud storage in the same project which can later be downloaded locally, by using cloud console or gsutil like this gsutil cp -R /gs/your_bucket_name/your_path /local_target
4. Then there is &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/python/tools/remoteapi"&gt;Remote API for python and Java&lt;/a&gt;, which perhaps was created to modify the datastore directly via code from your local machine
6. Finally there is a python utility called bulkloader.py which is coupled with &lt;strong&gt;remote_api&lt;/strong&gt;i , this utility does require python sdk to be installed and added to your system path.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
