Like other prefix trees, a ternary search tree can be used as an associative map structure with the ability for incremental string search. However, ternary search trees are more space efficient compared to standard prefix trees, at the cost of speed. Common applications for ternary search trees include spell-checking and auto-completion.</description></item><item><title>Mod Proxy equivalent in IIS using ARR and URL Rewrite Module</title><link>https://varunpant.com/posts/mod-proxy-equivalent-in-iis-using-arr-and-url-rewrite-module/</link><pubDate>Sun, 25 Aug 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://varunpant.com/posts/mod-proxy-equivalent-in-iis-using-arr-and-url-rewrite-module/</guid><description>IIS7 is quite modular, it is shipped with lots of goodies as separate modules and together it is now one of the most powerful and flexible web server.
In this post I intent to cover how we can easily configure ARR and URL Rewrite Module to get a similar functionality as of Mod Proxy in Apache.
Here I will demonstrate configuration of a reverse proxy which according to the definition is</description></item><item><title>VPS Hosting Past and Present</title><link>https://varunpant.com/posts/vps-hosting-past-and-present/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Sep 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://varunpant.com/posts/vps-hosting-past-and-present/</guid><description>I had been hosting this blog in the past for an extremely competitive (read cheap) price here at Arvixe .

WebSocket is not just another incremental enhancement to conventional HTTP communications, it represents a large advance, especially for real-time, event driven web applications.
Normally when a browser visits a web page, an HTTP request is sent to the web server that hosts that page. The web server acknowledges this request and sends back the response.</description></item><item><title>Data URI and IE</title><link>https://varunpant.com/posts/data-uri-and-ie/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Jun 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://varunpant.com/posts/data-uri-and-ie/</guid><description>Few days ago I was experimenting with a nifty technique of embedding images in web pages by base64 encoding them first and then using a standard known as Data URI Scheme, which basically defines a method of assigning a ‘src’ of an image tag as a base64 serialized string, like this:
background-image: url(&amp;#34;data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABkAAAAUBAMAAACKWYuOAAAAMFBMVEX///92dnZ2dnZ2dnZ2dnZ2dnZ2dnZ2dnZ2dnZ2dnZ2dnZ2dnZ2dnZ2dnZ2dnZ2dnYvD4PNAAAAD3RSTlMAACTkfhvbh3iEewTtxBIFliR3AAAAUklEQVQY02NgIBMwijgKCgrAef5fkHnz/y9E4kn+/4XEE6z/34jEE///A4knev7zAwQv7L8RQk40/7MiggeUQpjJff+zIpINykbIbhFSROIRDQAWUhW2oXLWAQAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==&amp;#34;); Although this technique could save some server round trips, however Microsoft ver. (IE &amp;lt; 8). does not support this scheme even though its a standard, which then makes this technique unfavorable to use as its not cross browser.</description></item></channel></rss>
