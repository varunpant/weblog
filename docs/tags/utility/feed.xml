Lets say that we have a data set where the values are in a range of 1 to 10, however we wish to normalise it to a range between 0 and 5
Mathematically speaking the equation comes down to

Importing a table from CSV Assuming you already have a table in place with the right columns, the command is as follows
COPY FROM &amp;lsquo;/path/to/csv/SourceCSVFile.csv&amp;rsquo; DELIMITERS &amp;lsquo;,&amp;rsquo; CSV;
Exporting a CSV from a table. COPY TO &amp;lsquo;/path/to/csv/TargetCSVFile&amp;rsquo; DELIMITERS &amp;lsquo;,&amp;rsquo; CSV;
Its important to mention here that generally if your data is in unicode or need strict Encoding, then Always set client_encoding before running any of the above mentioned commands.</description></item><item><title>Serve the contents of any directory with Python's SimpleHTTPServer</title><link>https://varunpant.com/posts/serve-the-contents-of-any-directory-with-python-s-simplehttpserver/</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 Feb 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://varunpant.com/posts/serve-the-contents-of-any-directory-with-python-s-simplehttpserver/</guid><description>Generally, when I am in a middle of prototyping a concept or in a need of quickly executing Ajax requests or using browser features which would need the page to be hosted on a web server, I use Python's SimpleHTTPServer module.

since div is a block element, i.e. it takes up the full width available, and has a line break before and after it, it can easily be centered using relative styling
{ margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; width:70%; background-color:#b0e0e6; } However lately I have preferred using absolute positioning technique over relative, this works for all browsers and is best for login screens or alert messages over a translucent shim.</description></item><item><title>Basic authentication in web.py via attribute</title><link>https://varunpant.com/posts/basic-authentication-in-web-py-via-attribute/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Jan 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://varunpant.com/posts/basic-authentication-in-web-py-via-attribute/</guid><description>Here I demonstrate the process of Basic Authentication in web.py python web framework.
There is a proof of concept article provided in the main site,however I just thought doing the same via an attribute might be a cleaner solution.
HTTP Basic authentication implementation is one of the easiest ways to secure web pages because it doesn't require cookies, session handling, or the development of login pages. Rather, HTTP Basic authentication uses static headers which means that no handshakes have to be done in anticipation,however the n the credentials are passed as plain-text and could be intercepted.</description></item><item><title>Installing Redis on Ubuntu</title><link>https://varunpant.com/posts/installing-redis-on-ubuntu/</link><pubDate>Sun, 20 Jan 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://varunpant.com/posts/installing-redis-on-ubuntu/</guid><description>Redis is an open source, advanced key-value store.

Output compression is basically a process of compressing web servers response by using a loss-less compression algorithm called gzip.
This technique is fairly modern and almost all modern browsers honor it, however if a page is requested from a browser which does not send a header Accept-Encoding: gzip,deflate then the response comes back uncompressed.</description></item><item><title>Start Stop Restart Apache 2 Web Server</title><link>https://varunpant.com/posts/start-stop-restart-apache-2-web-server/</link><pubDate>Sat, 19 Jan 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://varunpant.com/posts/start-stop-restart-apache-2-web-server/</guid><description>I have been using Linux environment a lot lately, particularly for hosting my web experiments and other application.

background-image: url(&amp;#34;data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABkAAAAUBAMAAACKWYuOAAAAMFBMVEX///92dnZ2dnZ2dnZ2dnZ2dnZ2dnZ2dnZ2dnZ2dnZ2dnZ2dnZ2dnZ2dnZ2dnZ2dnYvD4PNAAAAD3RSTlMAACTkfhvbh3iEewTtxBIFliR3AAAAUklEQVQY02NgIBMwijgKCgrAef5fkHnz/y9E4kn+/4XEE6z/34jEE///A4knev7zAwQv7L8RQk40/7MiggeUQpjJff+zIpINykbIbhFSROIRDQAWUhW2oXLWAQAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==&amp;#34;); Although this technique could save some server round trips, however Microsoft ver. (IE &amp;lt; 8). does not support this scheme even though its a standard, which then makes this technique unfavorable to use as its not cross browser.</description></item></channel></rss>
