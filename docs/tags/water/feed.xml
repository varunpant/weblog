&lt;p&gt;Its been a while since my last post, had been busy with office work…sigh!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, I was poking around web to come up with interesting water simulation techniques, as you could see in many games these days, so I did find a reference to an old C-based technique, after little refinement, what I have is a water simulation which uses a very old algorithm based on two &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heightmap"&gt;heightmaps&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always it’s a grid based animation which divides the screen into a mesh(more slices better this simulation looks), I use a jagged array in c# to do this (load it with a texture of 640 X 480 dimension ), to animate I use another array of same dimensions, now to make every thing move I kinda do something like this&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
