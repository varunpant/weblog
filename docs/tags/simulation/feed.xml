&lt;p&gt;LIMBO is a horrifically beautiful, monochrome or rather a gray-scale purgatory painted perhaps while watching Tim burton movie on the side. It was published initially in Jul 2010 by &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Game_Studios"&gt;Microsoft Game Studios&lt;/a&gt;(XBLA) and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playdead"&gt;Playdead&lt;/a&gt;(PSN, Windows), and then later released for Windows platform by &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_%28software%29"&gt;Steam&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The primary character of the game is a boy, who wakes up right at the beginning of the game i.e while you are trying to figure out WTF is happening or wonder if you graphics driver (windows platform) screwed up or something, but there as you are fiddling with the movement buttons in keyboard you will see pair of bright white eyes flickering, and that’s when you start falling in love with the game and the care of detail added in a game which is totally unlike other in its league.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Water Simulation</title><link>https://varunpant.com/posts/water-simulation/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Sep 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://varunpant.com/posts/water-simulation/</guid><description>
&lt;p&gt;Its been a while since my last post, had been busy with office work…sigh!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, I was poking around web to come up with interesting water simulation techniques, as you could see in many games these days, so I did find a reference to an old C-based technique, after little refinement, what I have is a water simulation which uses a very old algorithm based on two &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heightmap"&gt;heightmaps&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always it’s a grid based animation which divides the screen into a mesh(more slices better this simulation looks), I use a jagged array in c# to do this (load it with a texture of 640 X 480 dimension ), to animate I use another array of same dimensions, now to make every thing move I kinda do something like this&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Liquid Particles</title><link>https://varunpant.com/posts/liquid-particles/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jul 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://varunpant.com/posts/liquid-particles/</guid><description>
&lt;p&gt;After ages of constantly being one of the most used browser as well as a serious pain in Butt!!! IE is finally about to mature into something good and perhaps a useful software , with its support to &lt;a href="http://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2010/06/more_ie9_goodne.html"&gt;most&lt;/a&gt; of the standards being used today , IE will join back the league of web 3.0 browsers, hopefully very soon&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I was going through various experiments done with Canvas and came across a great example on &lt;a href="http://spielzeugz.de/html5/liquid-particles.html"&gt;Liquid Particle physics simulation&lt;/a&gt;, which amazingly is written in JavaScript and Canvas element, I was so mesmerized by the application that I had to port it to &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/bb187358.aspx"&gt;SilverLight&lt;/a&gt;, using &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.media.imaging.writeablebitmap.aspx"&gt;WritableBitmap&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
