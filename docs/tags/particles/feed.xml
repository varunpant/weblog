&lt;p&gt;After ages of constantly being one of the most used browser as well as a serious pain in Butt!!! IE is finally about to mature into something good and perhaps a useful software , with its support to &lt;a href="http://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2010/06/more_ie9_goodne.html"&gt;most&lt;/a&gt; of the standards being used today , IE will join back the league of web 3.0 browsers, hopefully very soon&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I was going through various experiments done with Canvas and came across a great example on &lt;a href="http://spielzeugz.de/html5/liquid-particles.html"&gt;Liquid Particle physics simulation&lt;/a&gt;, which amazingly is written in JavaScript and Canvas element, I was so mesmerized by the application that I had to port it to &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/bb187358.aspx"&gt;SilverLight&lt;/a&gt;, using &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.media.imaging.writeablebitmap.aspx"&gt;WritableBitmap&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
