&lt;p&gt;Its been a while since my last post, had been busy with office work…sigh!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, I was poking around web to come up with interesting water simulation techniques, as you could see in many games these days, so I did find a reference to an old C-based technique, after little refinement, what I have is a water simulation which uses a very old algorithm based on two &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heightmap"&gt;heightmaps&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always it’s a grid based animation which divides the screen into a mesh(more slices better this simulation looks), I use a jagged array in c# to do this (load it with a texture of 640 X 480 dimension ), to animate I use another array of same dimensions, now to make every thing move I kinda do something like this&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Liquid Particles</title><link>https://varunpant.com/posts/liquid-particles/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jul 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://varunpant.com/posts/liquid-particles/</guid><description>
&lt;p&gt;After ages of constantly being one of the most used browser as well as a serious pain in Butt!!! IE is finally about to mature into something good and perhaps a useful software , with its support to &lt;a href="http://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2010/06/more_ie9_goodne.html"&gt;most&lt;/a&gt; of the standards being used today , IE will join back the league of web 3.0 browsers, hopefully very soon&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I was going through various experiments done with Canvas and came across a great example on &lt;a href="http://spielzeugz.de/html5/liquid-particles.html"&gt;Liquid Particle physics simulation&lt;/a&gt;, which amazingly is written in JavaScript and Canvas element, I was so mesmerized by the application that I had to port it to &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/bb187358.aspx"&gt;SilverLight&lt;/a&gt;, using &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.media.imaging.writeablebitmap.aspx"&gt;WritableBitmap&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
