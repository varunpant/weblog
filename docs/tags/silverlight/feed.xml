Anyways, I was poking around web to come up with interesting water simulation techniques, as you could see in many games these days, so I did find a reference to an old C-based technique, after little refinement, what I have is a water simulation which uses a very old algorithm based on two heightmaps.
As always it’s a grid based animation which divides the screen into a mesh(more slices better this simulation looks), I use a jagged array in c# to do this (load it with a texture of 640 X 480 dimension ), to animate I use another array of same dimensions, now to make every thing move I kinda do something like this</description></item><item><title>Liquid Particles</title><link>https://varunpant.com/posts/liquid-particles/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jul 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://varunpant.com/posts/liquid-particles/</guid><description>After ages of constantly being one of the most used browser as well as a serious pain in Butt!!! IE is finally about to mature into something good and perhaps a useful software , with its support to most of the standards being used today , IE will join back the league of web 3.0 browsers, hopefully very soon
So I was going through various experiments done with Canvas and came across a great example on Liquid Particle physics simulation, which amazingly is written in JavaScript and Canvas element, I was so mesmerized by the application that I had to port it to SilverLight, using WritableBitmap.</description></item></channel></rss>
