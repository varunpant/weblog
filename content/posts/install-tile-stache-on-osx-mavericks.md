This is quick tutorial about installing [Tilestache](http://tilestache.org/) library in OSX Mavericks.

 ### Step 1

 Make sure Developer tools are installed xcode-select --install

 Then add these flags to tell xcode to use python like rest of the world does

  export CFLAGS=-Qunused-arguments

  export CPPFLAGS=-Qunused-arguments

 Finally type in sudo easy\_install tilestache

 Thats it all done, you might see some warnings but thats fine ignore them .

 Read the introduction [here](http://mike.teczno.com/notes/tilestache.html) to get started

 Hope it helps.
