The autocomplete attribute specifies whether or not an input field should have autocomplete enabled.

 Autocomplete allows the browser to predict the value from locally saved history/cache. When a user starts to type in a field, the browser should display options to fill in the field, based on earlier typed values. 

 **Note:** The autocomplete attribute works with the following <input> types: text, search, url, tel, email, password, datepickers, range, and color.

 example usage:

 <input name="q" autocomplete="off" />
