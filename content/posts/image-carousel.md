Here is another of many JavaScript based Image Carousel, I had seen many similar to these made in SilverLight and Flash, I came across a wonderful [carousel](http://www.shinedraw.com/animation-effect/flash-vs-silverlight-image-carousel/) made in SilverLight sometimes back which was very fluid in behavior and could easily be customized and configured to take various shape and form.

 I have managed to port it to JavaScript, it works best on chrome or FF, hope this would be fun to play with.

 Enjoy!!!
