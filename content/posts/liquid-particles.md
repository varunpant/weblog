After ages of constantly being one of the most used browser as well as a serious pain in Butt!!! IE is finally about to mature into something good and perhaps a useful software , with its support to [most](http://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2010/06/more_ie9_goodne.html) of the standards being used today , IE will join back the league of web 3.0 browsers, hopefully very soon

 So I was going through various experiments done with Canvas and came across a great example on [Liquid Particle physics simulation](http://spielzeugz.de/html5/liquid-particles.html), which amazingly is written in JavaScript and Canvas element, I was so mesmerized by the application that I had to port it to [SilverLight](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/bb187358.aspx), using [WritableBitmap](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.media.imaging.writeablebitmap.aspx).
