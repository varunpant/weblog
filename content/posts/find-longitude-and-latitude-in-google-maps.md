This post is basically a way of quick appreciation to the **Google maps Team**, they are obviously a bunch of caring, loving people ,who make useful (although **surreptitious**) tools for the betterment of Geek Kind.

 So as most of you may have accidently clicked a mysterious looking link at the bottom of your Google maps page ( on the left hand panel)[![google_latlon_tool1](http://varunpant.com/static/resources/google_latlon_tool1_thumb_1.png)](http://varunpant.com/static/resources/google_latlon_tool1_4.png)

 This awesome looking link opens up a popup which lets you choose wonderful goodies which makes your Google maps page more useful than it already is:

 [![google_latlon_tool2](http://varunpant.com/static/resources/google_latlon_tool2_thumb.png "google_latlon_tool2")](http://varunpant.com/static/resources/google_latlon_tool2_2.png)

 Now one can choose things like Smart Zoom but this post is about **LatLng** marker and tooltip ,

 which are very handy,especially if one works as a GIS application developer.

 Ones you are done selecting, simply click **Save changes** and that’s it.(You may have to refresh your page though ).

 After these features have been enabled, a user can now right click anywhere on the map, and in the options window , a new link “**Drop latLng Marker**” will appear.

 [![google_latlon_tool3](http://varunpant.com/static/resources/google_latlon_tool3_thumb.png "google_latlon_tool3")](http://varunpant.com/static/resources/google_latlon_tool3_2.png)

 Select that and the obvious will happen.

 [![google_latlon_tool4](http://varunpant.com/static/resources/google_latlon_tool4_thumb.png "google_latlon_tool4")](http://varunpant.com/static/resources/google_latlon_tool4_2.png)

 and there you have it , an easy, helpful, Hidden(not anymore), but never the less extremely **useful** utility to get latitude and longitude from Google maps.
